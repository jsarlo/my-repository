The Vigenère cipher uses a 26×26 table with A to Z as the row heading and column heading This table is usually referred to as the Vigenère Tableau, Vigenère Table or Vigenère Square. We shall use Vigenère Table. The first row of this table has the 26 English letters. Starting with the second row, each row has the letters shifted to the left one position in a cyclic way. For example, when B is shifted to the first position on the second row, the letter A moves to the end.
To encrypt, pick a letter in the plaintext and its corresponding letter in the keyword, use the keyword letter and the plaintext letter as the row index and column index, respectively, and the entry at the row-column intersection is the letter in the ciphertext
To decrypt, pick a letter in the ciphertext and its corresponding letter in the keyword, use the keyword letter to find the corresponding row, and the letter heading of the column that contains the ciphertext letter is the needed plaintext letter. For example, to decrypt the first letter T in the ciphertext, we find the corresponding letter H in the keyword.
